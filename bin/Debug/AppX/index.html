    <h1 class="instructionLabel" id="instructionLabel"> Welcome to Snake. To play the game, use the arrows on your keyboard to move the snake. Try to collect as much fruit as possible without hitting any walls or your own body. Additionally, you can try to beat Bob, the neural network. Bob isn't very smart, so he will eventually die with a human-like score. Don't forget you can adjust the speed of the game to add some challenge or simply make Bob's runs take less time. Good luck and have fun!</h1>
